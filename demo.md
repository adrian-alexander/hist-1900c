"Why does this tutorial level matter?"

The tutorial level matters because it gives a brief overview of the course, explaining how [you don't necessarily need to be into tech to understand the course.](https://shawngraham.github.io/hist1900/#do-i-have-to-be-techy-to-get-anything-out-of-this-course)
It also explains how to setup a Github account and Obsidian, which are useful technologies outside the course.
